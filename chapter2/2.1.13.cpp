/* Permutation Sequence
The set[1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, We get the following sequence(ie, for n = 3):
"1 2 3"
"1 3 2"
"2 1 3"
"2 3 1"
"3 1 2"
"3 2 1"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
Note Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
